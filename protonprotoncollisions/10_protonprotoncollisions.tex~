\section{Cross section}\index{Cross Section}
Imagine a 2-D box in deep space, away from gravity, containing some number of large 2D disks.  If you threw a ball at the box, the probability of hitting a disks is related to the ratio of the cross sectional area of the box to the cross sectional area of the disks.  The cross sectional area of the disks is their 
``cross section'', often denoted ${\rm \sigma}$ and has units of area.  
If you look at a solid and imagine scattering particles off the nuclei inside them, it is similar.  Remember that solids are, after all, mostly empty space.  If you project all the nuclei into the 2D front face of the solid, you have our 2-D box.  The cross section area of a nuclei is measured in ${\rm fm^{2}}$.  
For low energy scattering by the strong force, since the strong force only has a very short range, and interactions can only happen if the ball virtually touches the nucleus, this is a good approximation.  A unit commonly used in the barn, which is \(10^{28} m^{2}\).  Nuclear �cross sections� are around 80 mbarns.  For forces with a longer range, such as E\&M, we define instead an �effective� area.  See any introductory book on particle physics for a more precise definition.

What if instead you threw a steady stream of balls at the box and wanted to calculate the rate at which balls hit beads and are deflected?  Also, as you can imagine, in realistic beams the projectiles do not march single file.  You should imagine them moving in a cylinder with some cross section, like Figure ~\ref{fig:beam}.
 
\begin{figure}[h]
\centering\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{./protonprotoncollisions/Pictures/beam.pdf}
\caption{cartoon of a beam of particles}
\label{fig:beam}
\end{figure}



If the number of balls in the beam per unit volume is ${\rm n_a}$, 
and the velocity of the balls is v,  then the number of balls reaching the target per second is

\begin{equation}\Phi = n_{a}v\end{equation}

and \(\Phi\) is called the flux.  What are the units of \(\Phi\)?

The number of scatters per second is then

\begin{equation}\frac{dN}{dt}=\Phi \sigma
\end{equation}

(check that the units work).

Now, you may ask what happens in a collider?  Well, it is just the same.  You can always move to a frame where one of the protons is at rest, do the calculation there, and move back.  We will see in the next section why our calculation of the cross section does not depend on the frame in which it is calculated.

\section{On cross sections}
One of the things we need to be able to predict, for our collider, is how many ``hard'' scatterings will occur and how many of each type of particle will be made.  As we saw in the previous section, this is related to a number called the cross sections.  Using the equations of the Standard Model, we can calculate all kinds of cross sections.  We can calculate the cross section for an up quark to annihilate with an anti-up quark with a center-of-mass energy of 125 GeV to produce a virtual Z, which then decays to an electron and a positron.  We can calculate the cross section for a down quark to annihilate with an anti-down at a center-of-mass energy of 87 GeV and form a virtual Z which then decays to a electron and a positron.  We can calculate the cross section for two gluons with a center-of-mass energy of 10 TeV to annihilate to a virtual gluon which then turns into a top quark and an anti-top quark.  

Now, of course, you don't know enough physics and math to do these actual calculations.  And of course you may be saying ``but...  I don't have a beam of up quarks, I have a beam of protons.  So what good does it do if the standard model can calculate the cross sections for up quarks when what I need is the cross section for protons''?

In the following, we are going to try to sketch out for you some of what goes into the calculation for these things and how we related the calculations for the particles of the standard model (say, the quarks) to objects containing many standard model particles (like the proton).

\section{s, t, u, and ${\rm Q^2}$}\index{mandel}

Just how complicated are these cross sections that result from Standard Model calculations?  
Are they monsterous equations of many variables?
Actually, if you think about it, you will realize that the resulting formula can not 
depend on any arbitrary quantity.  In fact, it can be shown (although we won't show you this!)
that there are only a few variables, that are functions of the kinematics (4-momenta) of the initial or final state particles, on which the resulting cross sections can depend.

As we have seen, in relativity, there are ``invariants'' that will be 
measured to be the same by all observers, regardless of 
their frame and relative motion of the particle.  One of these is the length of a particle's 
4-momentum, which is its mass.  In collisions, there are a few of these variables that are important, as cross sections calculated from the standard model must be functions only of these variables and numeric factors.  The most important ones were unimaginably given the names s, t, u and 
${\rm Q^2}$.  Since these invariants are mass-like things, they will often turn out to 
be the mass of the virtual particle (one that is not an initial or final state particle, but
an intermediate particle that can not be observed) in the Feynmann diagram.

  
Imagine some kind of reaction (could be photon exchange, gluon exchanged, Z exchange etc) where two particles a and b come in and two particles c and d come out  (called a 2-to-2 reaction, figure ~\ref{fig:twototwo}).

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{./protonprotoncollisions/Pictures/fig1.pdf}
\caption{generic interaction of 2 particles going to 2 particles}
\label{fig:twototwo}
\end{figure}

If \(p_{a}\) is the 4-momentum of particle A and the 4-momenta of the other particles are named similarly, then

\begin{equation}s=(p_{a}+p_{b})^{2}\end{equation}
\begin{equation}t=(p_{a}-p_{c})^{2}\end{equation}
\begin{equation}u=(p_{a}-p_{d})^{2}\end{equation}

Remember: the square here means dot product, and the dot product of a 4-vector is the square root of the product of the first components (time-like components) minus the dot product of the 3D part of the 4 vector.  So s, t, u are a bit like a mass.  All these variables have units of \(GeV^{2}\).

Another important variable is \(Q^{2}\).  This can be u for some interactions and s for others.  It is the �mass� of the virtual particle that is exchanged in the interaction (the photon, W, Z, etc).  
Now, you may say: but the photon is massless!  But, that is only if it is observable.  The photon can be ``off-shell'' as long as it is unobservable (for times short compared to that set by the uncertainty principle, using M as E), meaning that it has a non-zero mass.  You will learn more about this when you study quantum mechanics.

Here we are just going to state the result of the cross section calculation in the standard model.
It can be shown in quantum field theory that, in the frame where the 4-momentum of particles a and b are equal but opposite and have high enough energy that we can neglect their mass, that the cross section can be calculated from the physics of the standard model using a simple formula

\begin{equation}
\frac{d?}{d\Omega} = \frac{1}{64\pi^{2}s}\frac{P_{f}}{P_{i}}|M|^{2}
\end{equation}

where \(p_{f}\) is the magnitude of the 3-momenta of either particle c or d (why doesn't it matter which?) and pi is that of either a or b and ${\rm \Omega}$ is the differential solid angle (so this is the rate as a function of the scattering angle for the final particle realtive to the initial particle). 
What will the ratio of pf to pi be if particles c and d both have momenta large compared to their mass as well?

\(|M|^{2}\)  is a factor called the ``matrix element'' which is calculated from the standard model and must be a function of s, t, u and numeric factors.



\section{What is in a Proton?}\index{What is in a Proton}
Okay, fine: we have just written down for you the differential cross section (relative to the final particle scattering angle) for particles in the standard model?  Now we will rough out how to go from that to the scattering for a proton with another proton.  But first, before we do that, we need to know what is in a proton.


You may have been taught that a proton contains two up quarks and a down quark.  This is not true.  In fact, only half the momentum of a proton is carried by quarks.  What carries the other half?  This is a complicated question.  Roughly, we can say that about half the momentum is carried by the up and down quarks, and about half by gluons.  And all these particles inside the proton have different momenta (but all very high, so that they are all going at the speed of light).  And what is worse, if you look at one time and then look again at another time, which types of particles and their momenta will change!  Sometimes most of the momenta will be held by one up quark.  Sometimes there will be 100 gluons with about a hundreth of the proton's momenta!  It is a seething mass of paritlces!


One of the goals of nuclear physics is to understand how the momentum distribution of the proton is divided amoung the protons constituents.  The ``Parton Distribution Functions'' or PDFs give the probability of finding a ``parton'' (a constituent of the proton, like a quark or gluon) with a fraction of the proton momentum x.  When you sum over all partons and all x, you should get 1 (when you add them all together, you have the whole momentum of the proton).  Figure ~\ref{fig:pdfpdf} shows results from measurements.  Note that the y axis is the average number of partons you will find at that momenta and type.  Of course, since this is a random, probabilistic thing, there will be fluctuations around this, governed by Poisson statistics.

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{./protonprotoncollisions/Pictures/fig2.pdf}
\caption{mean number of  partons that has a fraction x of the proton momentum times x for different parton flavors}
\label{fig:pdfpdf}
\end{figure}
However, the truth is, if you look inside a proton, what you see depends on how closely you look. The closer you look, the more detail you see.  Interactions with large \(Q^{2}\) look more closely that those that don�t (think about the uncertainty principal and it may help you understand).  That is why there are two figures in the picture shown above.  One shows what the proton looks like if you probe it with a virtual particle with low \(Q^{2}\) and the other shows it with a higher \(Q^{2}\) probe.

How do we do this?  Most of the information comes from ``fixed target experiments'', which collide a beam of particles with some kind of target, perhaps copper or something else that won't melt in a high radiation environment, and from the ``HERA'' collider in Hamburg Germany, which collides electrons with protons.

Imagine two possible beams in a fixed target experiment: muons and neutrinos.  Muons will interact with the up and down quarks (and other quarks) in the  proton via photons, more with the up quarks than with the down quarks due to their larger electric charge.  If we switch to a different target which has a different ratio of neutrons to protons, we get a different ratio of up and down quarks and different scattering rates.  Neutrinos interact with the protons and neutrons via the weak force, mostly the Z boson.  These also interact differently with up and down quarks, but in a different way.  Groups of theorists, such as �MRST� and �CTEQ� take all this data and untangle from it the �parton distribution functions�.  Note that neither type of beam interacts directly with gluons and therefore there is larger uncertainty on this part of the PDF than that of the quarks.

\section{Calculation of a cross section in proton proton collisions}\index{Calculation of a cross section in proton proton collisions}

Okay, now you have some idea what is in a proton.  How do we take the cross sections from the standard model and the PDFs and turn into into a cross section for proton-proton scattering.  Well, we have to imagine all the different partons that can make the final state we are interested in and sum over them.  In fact, we have to imagine all the momenta (x) for all the partons that can make the final state we are interested in and sum over that.  Since the possible momenta are continuaus, this becomes an integral, while the the other is over a finite number of possibilities, so it is a sum.



\begin{equation}
\sigma = \Sigma \int{dx_a dx_b \sigma_{ab}[q(x_a)\bar{q(x_b)}+q(x_b)\bar{q(x_a)}]}
\end{equation}

where the q's represent the PDFs for the quarks.

\section{What happens when two protons collide?}\index{What happens when two protons collide?}
First remember that quantum mechanics applies.  We can calculate the probability of certain kinds of interactions, but we cannot predict event by event which one will occur.  The pie chart shown in Figure ~\ref{fig:productionprobs} the fraction of collisions that result in different types of interactions.

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{./protonprotoncollisions/Pictures/fig3.pdf}
\caption{Pie chart showing relative probabilities of different types of interactions in proton-proton collisions}
\label{fig:productionprobs}
\end{figure}
Another way to look at this is using the cross sections, shown in Figures ~\ref{fig:lhcsigma1} and  ~\ref{fig:lhcsigma2}.

\begin{figure}[h]

\label{fig:lhcsigma2}
\end{figure}


What are these things?

\section{Minimum bias interaction}\index{Minimum bias interaction}

The most common thing to occur is that a small amount of momentum is exchanged between the proton, in the form of gluons, or color-neutral combinations of gluons, resulting in a few pions being spit out.  A cartoon might look Figure ~\ref{fig:minbias}. The $\pi^+, pi^-, \text{ and } pi^0 $ are produced in roughly equal numbers and at 14 TeV center of mass energy, about 100 pions are expected in every minimum bias interaction. The total transverse energy deposited by each such interaction is about 50 GeV.  These interactions are not very interesting to us. Unfortunately, as you can see from Figure ~\ref{fig:productionprobs}, majority of events are a result of his sort of interaction. The total cross-section for such interactions is hundreds of billions times larger than the interactions we are interested in, that is, interactions in which massive particles are produced. Given the limitations on how many interactions we can read and store, we need to select the ones we are interested in. This process of selection is called {\it Trigger}.

\caption{carton of a minimum bias interaction}
\label{fig:minbias}
\end{figure}

\section{Jets}\index{Jets}

The strong force is strong.  Therefore one of the most common things to make in proton-proton collisions are quarks and gluons.  As we know, these particles appear as jets of hadrons in our detector.  Some Feynman diagrams for this process are shown in Figure \ref{fig:jetfeyn}.  Typical event displays for this kind of event is shown in Figures \ref{fig:jetdis1} and \ref{fig:jetdis2}.  As we know, these particles appear as jets of hadrons in our detector.  Jets can be divided  into   {\it light} jets   and  {\it heavy-quark}  jets.  The light jets are initiated by light quarks or gluons, whereas heavy jets are initiated by heavy quarks, for example the botton quark.    As we know a single quark cant exist, shortly after creation the bottom quarks turn into B hadrons. One of the most important property of b hadrons is that they have a long life time (well, relatively long).  Mean life time of B hadrons is of about  $10^{-12}$ seconds, compared to $\pi^0$ meson lifetime of about $10^{-17}$ seconds. Because of this long life time, bottom quarks   can travel  few hundred microns or roughly a fraction of a millimeter before they decay. This distance seems small but can be measured with great precision by the LHC detectors. After traveling this small distance when a B hadron decays it creates what is called   a {\it secondary vertex}.  A jet with a {\it secondary vertex} is most probably a  bottom quark jet. This provides us an excellent tool to distinguish between light and heavy quarks and to identify events where a bottom quark was produced. This process of identification of bottom quark jets is called {b-tagging}. Figure \ref{fig:jetdis2}  shows cartoon of  secondary vertex in an event.
 

Any particle produced in the collisions loses some of its energy passing through the detector. Thus all partciles, electrons, photons, muons, etc need energy corrections. In the case of jets, being a messy object containing a large number of particles, measuring these energy corrections are quite challenging.  What we actually want to measure is the energy of the quark, before hadronization and formation of jets of particles.  Both real and simulated events are used to measure the corrections to the jet energies.

\section{W and Z production}\index{wz}

You can also make the carriers of the weak force, the W and Z bosons.  Some Feynman diagrams are shown in Figure ~\ref{fig:wzfeyn}.
An event display is shown in Figure ~\ref{fig:wzevent}. Since these partciles and their properties like mass and decay width are predicted by the standard model, measurements involving W and Z  bosons are used to test precision of standard model, as well as to calibrate the detector.

\caption{Event display for a Z boson}
\label{fig:wzevent}
\end{figure}

\section{top production}\index{topprod}

You could also make the heaviest of the quarks, the top quark.  The top quarks are much heavier than bottom quark and have a very short life time (~$10^{-23}$ seconds) and decays before it can even hadronize. The top quarks are the only known quarks that can directly decay to other particles, there by transferring many of their properties, e.g spin, to their decay products. Thus top quarks provide opportunity to study a quark directly, which is not the case for other quarks. Production of top quark is a very rare event in high energy collisions and there are many models of new physics that predict production of top quarks.   Most of the time a top quark decays in to a W boson and a bottom quark.  Presence of b-quark jet  in the event is thus a very good indicator that event might include top quark production. Most commonly, it is made with an anti-top.   The Feynman diagram is shown in Figure ~\ref{fig:topfeyn}, along with a pie chart showing the probabilities that the two tops in the events will decay to different final states containing particles stable on detector timescales.  A display of an event that could be top pair production is shown in Figure \ref{fig:topdisk}.

\section{ Underlying Event}\index{ue}

In hard interactions not all the partcons partcipate in the production of high mass particles.  The remaining quarks and gluons can hadronize just like  minimum bias interactions and form what is known as {\it underlying event}.
