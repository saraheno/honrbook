\section{Review of Collisions}\index{collisions}

Collisions happen all the time.  Billard balls collide with each other and with the walls of the billiard table.  Cars collide.  People in crowded room bump into each other.

Collisions are also one of the main ways we study the fundamental forces and particles.  We will review in this section what you learned in high school regarding collisions.  As you may remember, when analyzing what will happen when you collide two objects, conservations laws are very important, especially conservation of energy and conservation of momentum.  You may also remember that there are two classes of collisions: elastic and inelastic.  In an elastic collision, kinetic energy is conserved.  In an inelastic collision, the kinetic energy might change due to changes in other forms of energies.  Kinetic energy may be changed into heat energy when an object is deformed.  Chemical energy might become kinetic energy if something explodes.  Let's do some simple collisions problems as a review.
